    What a year 2020 was! So glad we made it!!! &#128512
    <br />
    The tarot card for 2021 is 2+0+2+1=5
    <br /> 
    The 5th Major Arcana card is "The Hierophant"
<br /> 
So, I welcome you to the year of the Hierophant! 
</p>
</div>
<br />
<h2>
    What does this mean?
</h2>
<p>
    The Hierophant can represent a new path and we are encouraged to be open to new ideas this year. 
    <br />
    The Hierophant may appear physically in your life as a wise teacher. 
</p>
<h2>
    Calculate your year card
</h2>
<p>
    You can also work out what card will influence your year. To work out your year card, take your birthday excluding the year you were born. 
    Replace the year you were born with the current year. 
    For example, if your birthday is 14 February, add 14 and 2 and 2021
    1+4+2+2+0+2+1=12. Your year card is "The Hanged Man"
    <br/> 
    If you get a two digit number greater than 21, you need to add the two digits again. This is because year cards are selected from the Major Arcana cards and there are only 21 of them.
